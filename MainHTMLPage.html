    <p>
        Twisted Pair is a drama, sci-fi, fantasy movie made in 2018. 
        It was Directed by Neil Breen, known for his terrible movies. Twisted Pair is no exception, 
        it ranks a 5.1/10 and I believe that all of the good reviews are ironic. 
        Its estimated budget is five dollars, so why is Twisted Pair so bad? 
        Let me tell you why Twisted Pair is one of, if not the worst movie ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
        The movie starts with two twin babies eating and a narrator tells us their names, Caid and Cael. 
        The narrator (which is Caid) goes on about how normal the twins are, and we see them playing at the beach with a dog. 
        With an awkward screen freeze we are told that the twins were selected by the force and separated from their family. 
        The screen starts flashing, and the audio is terrible. The narrator continues and tells us that the force reprogrammed 
        their DNA and cells to give them superior powers. We learn that the twins were given a mission. 
        Their mission was to fight for good and defeat the evil in humanity using their powers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cael was not successful in his mission, even though they were reprogrammed and treated identically, 
        and because Cael was not successful over the years, the force decided to remove his powers, and remove him from the force. 
        Caid has also reached a robotic humanoid state, and has gained synthetic brain power. The movie does not say what that means. 
        The scene starts with Caid walking in front of a building (that is clearly green screened) and jumps 
        into what looks like the third floor window. The CGI for his jump is terrible. It is like he took a still image 
        of himself in a jumping pose, and dragged it across the screen in photoshop. After he jumps into the building, 
        Caid walks up to a small squad of soldiers and leads them through the building to protect them. 
        Then, the building explodes, and he walks out of the ruins talking about how he has defeated the forces of evil once again. 
        No combat/fighting actually took place, he just walked around a building in front of soldiers while the 
        building exploded constantly. That was one of the worst “action” scenes I have ever watched.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that mission, Caid heads back to his headquarters and talks to who I assume is his boss. 
        He gets his next mission, and it involves programmable V.R. (virtual reality) the corrupt version. 
        Caid explains it as a limitless digital universe connected to all shared virtual reality. 
        In the next scene Caid sits alone in an empty theater room and he narrates how much he misses Cael. 
        As he talks, the lights slowly dim until there is only one beam of light shining on Caid. 
        I actually like this scene because by placing him alone in an empty theater room it shows how lonely he is; 
        and I think the lights are used well.
    </p>
    <p>
        While Caid was walking around at night he bumps into a girl, knocking the papers out of her hand. 
        He tries to help her but she doesn’t want any help and turns him down, so he decides to ask her to 
        meet him at the spot they bumped into each other and she declines. Caid then decides to follow her home 
        and even follows her into her home. She starts making herself dinner but she doesn’t know he is in 
        the house with her. Caid then attacks her and they start fighting, and it looks like he is about to win, 
        but all of the sudden he asks “What’s for dinner?” and she says “Your favorite.”. 
        They apparently already knew each other. Then we jump to Caid talking about how much he misses his 
        brother again. This part of the movie is so jarring to watch and it just leaves you confused.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next scene we see 3 people get held up at gunpoint by what looks like Caid, but it could also be his twin. 
        These 3 guys are being held hostage for embezzlement, paying off politicians, and all sorts of crimes. 
        After Their captor gets them to admit to their crimes, he shoots all 3 of them and leaves them to die. 
        The camera zooms out and we see more and more hostages are shown, implying that three was just the beginning 
        and more were left to the same fate as the first three.
    </p>
    <p>
        Caid goes on his next mission, to work as a double agent to Mr. Kurze. Mr. Kurze apparently is trying to take over the world. 
        Mr. Kurze and Caid talk but it doesn’t look like Caid succeeded yet. 
        We learn that Cael was behind the murders of the three people, and that the three were not actually the first, 
        he has a history of murdering corporate businessmen. We also learn that Cael and, I assume his girlfriend, 
        are both drug addicts and abusive towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        We jump to the next scene and see Caid walk into an unknown building and say “I can stop all of this myself.”, 
        I have no idea what he is talking about in this scene. This movie doesn’t really explain anything, 
        like I still don’t know what evil they’re talking about, what is the force, what building did Caid go in, 
        and what is he stopping? Anyways, in the building we can see a handful of guys wearing all black with gas masks on their faces, 
        and they have AR’s. Caid is sneaking around looking for something, we don’t know yet, until he finds a laboratory 
        and goes inside; then he says “Kuze’s biological mutant warfare plans must be stopped.” This must be why Caid is here in a lab.
        Caid picks up a beaker or something, I don’t know what it is, and calls it programmable matter, which he says can make 
        itself into anything. Maybe this is Kuze’s plan, to use programmable matter to take over the world?
    </p>
    <p>
        Caid then runs out of the room down the hall and up some stairs, and finds four guys sitting in chairs right next to him. 
        They don’t acknowledge him in any way, so he moves on down the hall. It cuts to Caid in a room talking to someone with a 
        purple scarf, surrounded by the dudes sitting the chair it looks like. The guy with the purple scarf yells at 
        Caid that he is in control, Caid yells back that he is not in control, and we will not let you take back control. 
        Then, everyone fades away except for Caid. This scene makes no sense. We cut to Cael and he breaks up with his girlfriend, 
        and then we cut right back to Caid. Caid enters another random building and says, “I need to end the Kuze empire now, 
        before his plan begins.”. The building is full of pipes, and he places bombs to blow it all up, and as always, 
        terrible explosion effects play as he runs around blowing it all up. I do not know the significance of the pipes being blown up,
        or why he even went after the pipes in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the next couple of scenes we find out that Caid’s girlfriend was a spy for Kuze. Caid is devastated to find out, 
        but he uses that feeling to go and end Kuze. So, he goes back into the same building with the laboratory, 
        but once he enters the building there are four guards with rifles. Hilariously, they shoot at him but he just runs past them, 
        so you would expect the guards to chase him right? No, once Caid leaves their vision, the guards don’t move at all 
        and act like nothing happened. Once in the laboratory, Caid just blows the entire lab and computer lab up. 
        The explosion effects are still terrible. Caid returns home and says hello to his girlfriend, 
        but because she was a spy she tries to shoot him in the back, but he turns around and they shoot each other at the 
        same exact time. His girlfriend dies, and Caid is devastated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Caid and Cael telepathically forgive each other and make up, Caid missed Cael and was mad that Cael threw it all away.
        Cael felt slighted because he was removed from the force. The movie ends with Caid giving a motivational message to the viewer, 
        and it is alright. He just says that everyone should have the right to love.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think Twisted Pair has a good premise, it was executed horribly. The special effects, acting, 
        and editing make the movie look like it was a high school project, the story makes no sense. 
        The movie was not received well at all, it got a 5.1 on IMDB.
        I do think this is a good movie if you like to laugh at terrible movies. Overall, it is hard to give this movie more than a 2/10.
